## Our pipeline of data proprecessing
We preprecess the whole-slide images using a pipeline in our laboratory and extract the feature vectors of the pathology images

And more details and the code of this pipeline can be seen in [https://github.com/1996lixingyu1996/CRCNet](https://github.com/1996lixingyu1996/CRCNet)
## Our clustering algorithm

## Proposed MIL algorithm
We use the unsupervised clustering method to select predictive image patches
